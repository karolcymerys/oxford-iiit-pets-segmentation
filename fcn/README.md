# Fully Convolutional Network
___

## Implementations
___


## Experiments

In order to compare performance of above implementations. There was utilized __Oxford III-T Pets__.
As a metric mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) was utilized. Models are compared on validation sets:

| __Loss Function__  | __FCN-VGG-32s__ | __FCN-VGG-16s__ | __FCN-VGG-8s__ |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------| 
| Cross-entropy Loss | N/A             | N/A             | N/A            | 
| Dice Loss          | N/A             | N/A             | N/A            |
